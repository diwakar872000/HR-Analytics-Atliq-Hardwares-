# Project Overview
This project aims to empower the HR team at Atliq with valuable insights into employee behavior and preferences, ultimately enhancing productivity. Through the implementation of this comprehensive dashboard, we will gain a deeper understanding of important terminologies such as WFH (Work from Home), SL Count (Sick Leave Count), P (Present), HP (Half Pay Leave), PL (Pay Leave), WO (Weekly Off), and HO (Holiday Off). By leveraging these insights, the HR team can tailor their strategies and initiatives to create an environment that maximizes employee engagement and productivity.
# Valuable Insights
--Work from Home Count:  Analyzing the data, we observe a significant increase in the number of employees opting for remote work arrangements on fridays. This trend highlights the growing preference for flexibility and the successful integration of remote work policies within our organization.

--Sick Count: By monitoring sick leave data, we gain insights into employee well-being and health trends. Analyzing this information helps us identify patterns, address potential issues, and implement wellness programs that support our employees' physical and mental well-being.

--Office Presence: HR analytics reveals interesting trends in employee office presence. We notice higher attendance rates on certain days, suggesting a preference for in-office collaboration and face-to-face interactions. Understanding these patterns allows to optimize office spaces, foster team dynamics, and facilitate effective communication.
